This script should enable you to just drag and drop all the files in their corresponding folders within you bootloader.
You choose your motherboard etc and the script will gather the files for you.

Thanks to **Shilohh** for his original work.
Use his original guide as reference if you're building this for the first time: [https://bit.ly/3bcA14u](https://bit.ly/3bcA14u)
Already adapted users should be able to just drag and drop the files along with their previously configured **config.plist**.

If you have problems with permissions running the script:

```
chmod u+x <path_to_file>/shilohh_build.command
```
